# AWS Cloudformation Recipes

## What is AWS Cloudformation
AWS CloudFormation is an “infrastructure as code” service from Amazon Web Services. 
Instead of clicking around in the AWS console to create VPCs, subnets, databases, Lambdas, etc., you describe everything in a template file (YAML) and CloudFormation builds and manages it for you.

## Why recipes
A recipe lets you bake the same cake again and again.
CloudFormation templates do the same for your infrastructure:
  1. You can repeat the same setup reliably
  2. Easy to create multiple environments
  3. Fast rebuild & disaster recovery
  4. Documentation for free
